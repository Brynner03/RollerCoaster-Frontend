        description: 'A top hat tower of 456 ft looms up menacingly as you board its trains, on the dual loading platform. And the first impulse experienced, being locked inside a loaded train, is undoubtedly one of anxious anticipation. Be on your guard, for the train takes off every few minutes as it plunges 418 ft to form a 270-degree spiral while going down a U-shaped track. If your adventurous heartsix craves for more, go for the 12 other coasters housed inside the park and finally to let off some steam, unwind at the wildlife park, "Safari Off Road Adventure".',
